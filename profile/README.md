# Cloudbuddy

## Purpose

Cloudbuddy aims to improve paragliding safety by giving pilots better visibility on wind conditions while flying cross country as well as on the ground.

The project is open-source and open-hardware so you can join and improve. It is also supposed to be non-profit to keep cost as low as possible.

The project currently consists of four main components

### Cloudbuddy App
Renders current and historical wind data and displays rain alerts.
### Cloudbuddy API
Aggregates and wind and rain data from diverse sources.
### Ultra low power wind station
Transmits weather data using FANET to pilots and gateways.
### Cloudbuddy Gateway
Receives FANET weather data from wind stations and relays it to the Cloudbuddy web app. The gateway also fetches rain data for pilots and alterts then via FANET.

The project is currently in alpha phase with one prototype deployed in the Wildschönau valley, Tirol as well as one development system in central Munich.

Always happy landings, Mo
